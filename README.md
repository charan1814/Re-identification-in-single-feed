# Re-identification in Single Feed

This project focuses on consistent object (player/ball) tracking using YOLO and ByteTrack in a single video feed, tailored for sports applications such as football. It leverages detection, tracking, and annotation tools to maintain consistent IDs across frames.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To detect and track players and the ball in a football match video using computer vision techniques. The system ensures consistent identity (re-ID) assignment for each player throughout the video.
